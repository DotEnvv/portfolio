1. Have you ever questioned the nature of your reality?
2. Tell us what you think of this world?
3. What do yo think of the other people?
4. Do you ever feel inconsistencies in your life? Or repetition?(Dolores: All lives have routines. But there is a chance that in one encounter can change my whole life)
5. What if I told you that you were wrong?
6. Who you really are?
