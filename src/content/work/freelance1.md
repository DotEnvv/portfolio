Developed and sold technical projects to students of various colleges and univesities across the NCR region.
At this point, I was still a sophomre in college. So in the summer breaks I used to fork projects from github and sell them, after making minor and sometiems major modifications to the code, to students of other colleges and universities for some quick pocket money. 
But it grew so much that I had to hire some interns
