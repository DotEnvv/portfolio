Ever since my first experience as a Freelance Developer back in my sophomore year, I couldn't shake off the freedom and excitement that comes along with it. 
After working/interning at some places that excited me with their work, I still kept thinking about doing my own thing, so I took a 2 month hiatus after my last internship(Sep 2021), and have been working full time as a Freelance Software Developer since then.

I have made things ranging from marketing websites, landing pages for individuals, to fully fledged and complex shaders for various game developers(mostly indie).

Apart from that, my interest in making generative art using JavaScript and Glsl, and selling them as NFTs and digits assets to other developers, helped me setup a steady stream of income.
