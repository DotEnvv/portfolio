It was not my first job as a teacher, but definitely the one where I learnt the most. 
Apart from gathering like-minded students(mostly juniors) for conducting SIGs(self interest groups), my job as an Instructor also included teaching them following subject:
- C/C++
- OOPS
- Python
- Basics of algorithms and data structures

I did this alongside a bit of freelance work
